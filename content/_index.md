# Host web apps in a local, resilient mesh network

LoRes Mesh is an open source project to allow you to run local servers, connected both over the internet and by other approaches that might work when the internet is down.

It will help you build a local, sustainable and resilient network for your neighbourhood.

If you're a developer, try our [docs for creating an app](/docs/creating_a_lores_app/).

If you're a community organiser, volunteer or impact investor, you might want to get a sense of our [planned roadmap](/roadmap) and find out how to [contact us](/contact)
