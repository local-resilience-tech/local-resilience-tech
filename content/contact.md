## About Merri-bek Tech

**LoRes Mesh** is currently a project of [Merri-bek Tech](https://www.merri-bek.tech/). Merri-bek Tech is a local tech resilience association that serves an area of the norther suburbs of Naarm (Melbourne, Australia) that covers about 12 suburbs and houses about 180,000 people.

We're building LoRes Mesh in order to serve our needs, and we think it'd be useful for other local resilience groups, and many other applications. If other groups get involved in using and contributing to LoRes Mesh, we'll change the governance processes of this project to better handle more stakeholders.
