_As a_ **Node Steward**
_I want to be able to_ **follow clear instructions that help me set up a Raspberry Pi for Co-op Cloud apps**
_So that we can_ **start to practice hosting apps on the Pi**

Easy node setup is somewhat relative. Easy to who? Our current audience for this is "somewhat technical". A lot of our early adopters have technical experience, at least in general operation of Linux. We don't want to produce a black box that can't be studied by experts if things go wrong. However, we do want to make the path towards gaining expertise feel accessible and rewarding for a large number of people.

To achieve this, our documentation should be friendly, beginner focused, and avoid jargon. Our installers should minimise the number of technologies that need to be learned, and should provide a clear paved road for our common use-case.

## What success looks like

- [x] This website has [documentation](/docs/node_stewards/initial_setup/raspberry_pi/) with clear instructions to setup a Raspberry Pi with Co-op Cloud
- [ ] This has been used to setup 3 nodes, as demonstrated by serving up the Traefik web dashboard

### Current status

We are working on getting test nodes set up.

- [x] [Radish house node](https://traefik.radish.nodes.merri-bek.tech)
- [ ] 2nd node
- [ ] 3rd node
