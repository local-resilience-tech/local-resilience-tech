_As a_ **Node Steward**
_I want to be able to_ **follow clear instructions that help me set up a LoRes node on a Raspberry Pi**
_So that we can_ **start to practice shipping software to early adopters**
{{< /user_story >}}

Easy node setup is somewhat relative. Easy to who? Our current audience for this is "somewhat technical". A lot of our early adopters have technical experience, at least in general operation of linux. We don't want to produce a black box that can't be studied by experts if things go wrong. However, we do want to make the path towards gaining expertise feel accessible and rewarding for a large number of people.

To achieve this, our documentation should be friendly, beginner focussed, and avoid jargon. Our installers should minimise the number of technologies that need to be learned, and should provide a clear paved road for our common use-case.

## What success looks like

- _LoRes Node_ is built and ready to install on new nodes
- There is a section in the [docs](/docs) part of this website with clear install instructions
- This has been used to setup 3 nodes by people who aren't active developers on LoRes Node.
