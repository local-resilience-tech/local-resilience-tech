Reading downwards, our planning roadmap extends into the future. The further you go beyond the in-progres work, the less certain things become. We're not averse to changing things at any time, so treat this as current indicative thinking rather than any sort of promise.

Would it be useful for your project or organisation if we focussed on different things? Let us know.
