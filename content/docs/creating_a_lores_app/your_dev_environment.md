If you're going to work on LoRes Apps, you're going to need a setup on your own computer that makes it easy to try them out.
{{< /hero >}}

That means temporarily running the **LoRes Node** software on your computer. You can of course test out an LoRes App on a server running a LoRes Node, but that's going to make it hard to tweak and test things as you go.

## Prerequisites

What sort of computer and software will you need to be able to do this?

- **Linux**. You'll need to be running linux on your computer. It's probable that other unix-like systems would work. For the rest of these docs, we're going to assume you're running Ubuntu or Debian linux.
- **Git**. You'll need git installed, and somewhere you can share your repository with others. We recommend [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/).

### Do I really need to be running linux?

So you probably already know that Linux is an open source operating system, an alternative to Windows or Mac OSX. Running it on your computer, either as your only OS, or by dual-booting so you can use it occasionally, is a great idea because it's free, open, and really nice to use.

The reason for mentioning it here though isn't to get your to change your computing life, but because Linux is the most common choice for web servers, and it's what we need to run on our LoRes Nodes. If you run it on your own machine, it just it easier to follow these instructions.

Want help getting started with Linux? There's probably a Linux club or user group where you live that would live to help you out. For example, [here's a list](https://linux.org.au/lugs/) for Australia.

More advanced users can probabaly translate these instructions for Mac OSX, or for one of the several ways of running linux inside Windows.
