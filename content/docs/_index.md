Help build a resilient local mesh for your neighbourhood.
{{< /hero >}}

This documentation is designed to help you participate in setting up and running a **LoRes Mesh**. Helping our local communities in this way could appeal to anyone, so our documentation doesn't assume years of technical knowledge. If you do have years of technical knowledge, we'll try and provide you with some options to skip bits, but mostly the advice is to be patient and remember that we all learned this stuff once.

## Finding the right documentation

For now, we're starting with docs about how to setup and run a **LoRes Node**. We call this being a **Node Steward**. If that sounds like something that you might like to learn about, head over to the [documentation for Node Stewards](./node_stewards/)
