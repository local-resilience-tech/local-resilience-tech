{{<hero>}}
We have a [Raspberry Pi](../raspberry_pi), serving wikipedia the internet with [Co-op Cloud](../coop_cloud), but we need a way to link this up with our neighbourhood so that we can start to build a local resilient mesh that supports our community.
{{</hero>}}

{{<todo>}}
Layout a plan for using abra to install LoRes Node, building upon the processes developed in the last section. Include initial use of LoRes Node to setup or join a region, and register the kiwix app.
