# Lores Mesh Website

LoRest Mesh is an open source project for creating and managing local servers for hosting open source web applications and connecting them as part of a neighbourhood mesh.

## About LoRes Mesh

It is being developed by [Merri-bek Tech](https://www.merri-bek.tech/), a grassroots nonprofit technology group in Naarm (Melbourne, Australia) but is open source for collaboration and use by other interested parties.

The core code for Lores Node, the main software application being developed, is currently [in this github repo](https://github.com/local-resilience-tech/lores-node/) but we hope to move it to Codeberg soon.

## Purpose of this Website

This website will be the public facing project website for developing and using LoRes Mesh, including developing applications for it. Our initial purpose to to write high quality documentation to be used by slightly less technical volunteers (initially at Merri-bek Tech) to try node deployments and app development.

We want this website to have a friendly tone, and to explain tech industry jargon when it is introduced, to make working with LoRes as accessible as possible.

## Technology

This website is built with the Hugo static site generator. To try it out locally, run `hugo server`.
